## Installation
To use the algorithms in this repository, clone the repo to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mustafaiqbal2/Algorithms-Project.git
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory of the algorithm you want to run and compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler. For example, to run the algorithm in `Algorithm.cpp`:
```bash
cd A_1/Algoritms
g++ Algorithm.cpp -o Algorithm
./Algorithm
```
